Performance Evaluation of MNIST Classification Models
Description:
This notebook evaluates the performance of various classification models on the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digits. The lab includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and evaluation on validation and test datasets.

Dataset:
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

Sections:

Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Preprocessing
Model Selection
Evaluation on Validation Dataset
Evaluation on Test Dataset
Insights
Dependencies:

scikit-learn
matplotlib
pandas
numpy
Instructions:

Download the MNIST dataset.
Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
Execute the code cells in sequential order to run the notebook.
